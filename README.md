- Start the Node.js app and MongoDB services using docker-compose.yml

- Apply environment variables from your .env file (if configured)

- Mount persistent storage for MongoDB (as configured)

- Ensure consistent container-based environment across development and production

3. **Access the Application**

Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000

Replace the port if configured differently in docker-compose.yml

4. **Stop the Application**
To stop the application and remove containers:
