# BioBloom Backend MVC Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive backend refactoring of the BioBloom agricultural application, transforming it from a monolithic structure into a clean, scalable MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with modern development practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture Transformation

### Before: Monolithic Structure

- Single `server.js` file handling all functionality
- Mixed routing, business logic, and data access
- No clear separation of concerns
- Difficult to maintain and scale

### After: Clean MVC Architecture

- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Organized into Models, Controllers, Services, and Routes
- Middleware-driven request processing
- Scalable and maintainable codebase
